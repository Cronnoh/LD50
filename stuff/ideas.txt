Goal: take as much time as possible before landing on the ground
falling with balloons
    move slowly left and right
        double tap (shift?) to booster (limited fuel)
            0 y velocity
    effect downward speed
    more balloons = slower falling
    balloons pop when hit obstacles
Obstacles
    birds with sharp beaks pop balloons
        move horizontally (maybe also diagonally)
    thunder clouds
        shock from above
mouse control pull back fling something (clouds?)
    hit birds to stop attacks?
    hit player to stop downward
slingshot? diagonally?
sky squid?
    grab on to be pulled up
coins? (gold clouds?)
    flingable
    fuel for left right booster
rainbow?
    short period of invinciblity
    hitting thing bounces you up?
wind in 4 directions
arrows showing when things will appear on left and right
screen wrap around?
ground different levels of happy depending on score
different things spawn at different heights?
camera follow player if move up after camera stop


framing
    space ship crash landing
    ground impact imminent
    eject button = silly balloons

movement - commit to direction
cannot stay in one place because of thunder clouds
birds punish movement and force downward speed change
cloud fling to defeat birds
