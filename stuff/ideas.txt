Goal: take as much time as possible before landing on the ground
falling with balloons
    move slowly left and right
        double tap (shift?) to booster (limited fuel)
    effect downward speed
    more balloons = slower falling
    balloons pop when hit obstacles

        move horizontally (maybe also diagonally)
    thunder clouds
        shock from above

    hit birds to stop attacks?
    hit player to stop downward
slingshot? diagonally?

coins? (gold clouds?)
    flingable
    fuel for left right booster
